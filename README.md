### Notes On Project Tiers
 1. Front end:
   a. At time of writing, only the dashbaord page is complete for the front end. More will be added as I finish the project during the elective module (sprites will appear on the animal cards & in the Pet Home above the rescue center (currently a static image).
   b. However, as is, the front end is /usable/ and not horrendous to look at.
 2. Back end:
   a. Users can read/add/edit entries to the database. (For an example of editing, click the "Pet" option and observe what happens to your friendship bar in the Health Chart accordion!
   b. Users cannot currently "delete" entries directly from the front end (it makes me sad to delete rescued pets - I'll think of a thematic way to incorperate it as I continue development), HOWEVER - the delete route does exist & is functional.
 3. Deployment:
   a. The application & server are deployed on render.
 4. Continuous Deployment:
   a. The application & server both update their deployments on push/merge to their respective main branches.
 5. Login/Register/Authentication
   a. Login & registration occur using auth0 & can be tested on the front end app.
   b. Authentication also occurs on the front end - you can tell you've been successfull authenticated if the login button has been replaced with a logout button.
